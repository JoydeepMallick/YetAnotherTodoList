# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## How to code from scratch

For setup, open terminal and type :-

```bash
npm create vite@latest
# chose name of project or for current directory put period (.)
# chose react
# chose javascript or javascript + swc

# now install dependencies
npm i

# after its done, to run application in browser on specific port
npm run dev
```

Now code up the application and enjoy the development experience.


## Usage

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone 
cd YetAnotherTodoList
npm install
# Then, run the development server:
npm run dev
```
